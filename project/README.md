Hello, World! ,
This is my CS50P final project.


# My CS50P Final project

In my final project , I created a PYTHON program which determines which  superhero universe and grade you are based on your favorite character and birth-date respectively.
In my final project , I created a PYTHON program which determines which  superhero universe and grade you are based on your favorite character and birth-date respectively.

I created a directory called project, in which I created files project.py,
test_project.py, profiles1.csv, after.csv.


In project.py, I used the the example project structure, and created 3 functions along with main() :

correct_arg(): in which I checked the command-line arguments

select_universe(): in which I deteremined in which universe a person belongs based on their 'favorite character' from profiles1.csv

select_grade(): in which I determined in which grade they were based on their 'birth-date' from profiles1.csv

In test_project.py I tested the functions from project.py using 'assert'.

I created 'after.csv' to see ther output after entering 'python project.py profiles1.csv after.csv' in the
terminal window.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


- I learned a lot of Python, through building a ton of projects. This was a great experience and opportunity to learn Python. I would like to thank Harvard for providing this course, and David J. Malan without whom I think a lot of students would not have been able to learn Python as immersively as he taught.

- Thanks David J. Malan and Harvard.
